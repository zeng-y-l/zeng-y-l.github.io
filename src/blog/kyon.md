<!-- > The light novel series _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_, featuring a character named Haruhi who is a god unawares and her search for novelty, has a number of anomalies and unclear overarching plot.
>
> I argue that these anomalies can be resolved, and greater literary depth achieved, by interpreting Haruhi as an ordinary "not special" girl whose wish made her extraordinary, because the first-person protagonist Kyon is the actual unaware god. Like the bluebird of happiness, Kyon found happiness only when he forgot about himself to care more about another (making it a positive twist on Mark Twain's [_The Mysterious Stranger_'s](!W "The Mysterious Stranger") despairing demiurge). -->

> 轻小说系列《凉宫春日的忧郁》讲述了一位不自知的神明——春日——追求新鲜事物的故事，其中存在诸多异常和模糊不清的主线剧情。
>
> 我认为，这些异常可以得到解释，并能挖掘出更深的文学内涵。其关键在于将春日解读为一个原本普通而「不特别」的女孩，却因愿望而变得非凡，因为第一人称主角阿虚才是真正不自知的神明。就像传说中象征幸福的青鸟，阿虚只有在忘我地关心他人时，才找到了幸福（这构成了对{马克·吐温|Mark Twain}《[{神秘的陌生人|The Mysterious Stranger}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Stranger)》中那位绝望造物主设定的积极版本）。

<!-- The real joy of reading [Gene Wolfe](!W) is not so much for his imaginative plots^[Though it's hard to argue that works of his like _[The Fifth Head of Cerberus](!W)_ or _[The Book of the New Sun](!W)_ do not have fascinating stories and settings.] or for his masterly prose[^Ultan], but rather for the secret gems his stories conceal.
Many Wolfe stories follow the pattern of telling some remarkable story, which an ordinary reader can follow and enjoy with pleasure, and when they reach the end, they are satisfied. But a more devoted or perceptive reader will find far more than that^[Sometimes they can find *too* much; consider the many contradictory interpretations of Wolfe's short story "[Suzanne Delage](/suzanne-delage "'Interpreting ‘Suzanne Delage’', Gwern 2009")".]. (One thinks of Shakespeare, and how his plays change on re-reading.)
One reads through [_Peace_](https://www.siriusfiction.com/PaxBorskii.html) and is amused and interested by Alden Weer's reminiscences of 1900s Midwestern life; one re-reads it, and is troubled to discover that Weer is a ghost and his anecdotes conceal murders for which he yet moulders in his grave - that far from being idyllic, [_Peace_](https://www.amazon.com/Peace-Gene-Wolfe/dp/0765334569/) is better described as a horror story.
One reads through the diary that is the last third of _[The Fifth Head of Cerberus](!W)_, and one thinks about eccentric anthropologists. But perhaps on a re-read, one notices an inconsistency^[The specific clue is that the anthropologist is a crack shot and right-handed; his usurper is neither. If this seems excessively subtle to you, many would agree.] and realizes that the anthropologist was murdered and replaced halfway through. And so on. -->

阅读[{吉恩·沃尔夫|Gene Wolfe}](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%89%E6%81%A9%C2%B7%E6%B2%83%E7%88%BE%E5%A4%AB)作品的真正乐趣，与其说在于其天马行空的情节^[尽管很难说像《[The Fifth Head of Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Head_of_Cerberus)》或《[The Book of the New Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun)》这样的作品不具备引人入胜的故事和设定]或大师级的文笔[^Ultan]，不如说在于其故事中隐藏的秘宝。许多沃尔夫的故事都遵循这样的模式：讲述一个非凡的故事，普通读者可以愉快地跟随并享受，读到终篇时便心满意足。但更投入或更敏锐的读者会发现远不止于此^[有时他们可能发现**过多**内容；试想对沃尔夫短篇小说《[Suzanne Delage](https://gwern.net/suzanne-delage "'Interpreting ‘Suzanne Delage’', Gwern 2009")》层出不穷的矛盾解读]。（让人联想到莎士比亚，以及他的戏剧在重读时焕发的不同光彩。）初读《[Peace](https://www.siriusfiction.com/PaxBorskii.html)》，你会被 Alden Weer 对 1900 年代中西部生活的追忆逗乐并吸引；重读时，你会惊觉 Weer 实为幽魂，他的轶事掩盖了使其至今仍在坟墓中腐朽的谋杀案——原来《[Peace](https://www.amazon.com/Peace-Gene-Wolfe/dp/0765334569/)》远非田园牧歌，更应被归类为恐怖故事。初读构成《[The Fifth Head of Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Head_of_Cerberus)》最后三分之一篇幅的日记，你会思考那位古怪的人类学家。但或许重读时，你会注意到一处矛盾^[具体线索是：那位人类学家是神枪手且惯用右手；而篡位者两者皆非。若你觉得这过于隐晦，许多人亦有同感]，从而意识到人类学家在日记中途已被谋杀并取代。诸如此类。

<!-- [^Ultan]: The reason I began reading Gene Wolfe was because I idly picked up his _[The Shadow of the Torturer](!W)_ and began reading for half an hour. Some chapters into the book, I ran into a scene set in an ancient library (chapter 6, 'The Master of the Curators'). The librarian begins describing his wares, and the prose reaches a level I rarely see outside of such great authors as Oscar Wilde or Sir [Thomas Browne](!W):

     > '"...At last I realized that instead of reading it, I had been observing it as a physical object. The red I recalled came from the ribbon sewn to the headband so that I might mark my place. The texture that tickled my fingers still was that of the paper on which the book was printed. The smell in my nostrils was old leather, still bearing the traces of birch oil. It was only then, when I saw the books themselves, that I began to understand their care."
     >
     > His grip on my shoulder tightened. "We have books here bound in the hides of echidnes, krakens, and beasts so long extinct that those whose studies they are, are for the most part of the opinion that no trace of them survives unfossilized. We have books bound wholly in metals of unknown alloy, and books whose bindings are covered with thickset gems. We have books cased in perfumed woods shipped across the inconceivable gulf between creations - books doubly precious because no one on Urth can read them."
     >
     > "We have books whose papers are matted of plants from which spring curious alkaloids, so that the reader, in turning their pages, is taken unaware by bizarre fantasies and chimeric dreams. Books whose pages are not paper at all, but delicate wafers of white jade, ivory, and shell; books too whose leaves are the desiccated leaves of unknown plants. Books we have also that are not books at all to the eye: scrolls and tablets and recordings on a hundred different substances. There is a cube of crystal here - though I can no longer tell you where - no larger than the ball of your thumb that contains more books than the library itself does. Though a harlot might dangle it from one ear for an ornament, there are not volumes enough in the world to counterweight the other."
     >
     > "All these I came to know, and I made safeguarding them my life's devotion." -->

[^Ultan]: 我最初阅读吉恩·沃尔夫的契机，是偶然拿起他的《[The Shadow of the Torturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer)》读了半小时。读到第六章「The Master of the Curators」时，场景设在一座古老图书馆中。图书管理员开始描述他的藏品，其文笔达到了我仅在{奥斯卡·王尔德|Oscar Wilde}或[{托马斯·布朗|Thomas Browne}](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%89%98%E9%A9%AC%E6%96%AF%C2%B7%E5%B8%83%E6%9C%97)爵士等伟大作家作品中才得见的境界：

    > 「……最终我意识到，自己并非在阅读它，而是把它当作一个实体在观察。记忆中那抹红色来自缝在书脊顶端的丝带标记。指尖残留的触感是书籍印刷纸张的质地。萦绕鼻息的是古老皮革的气味，仍带着桦树油的痕迹。直到那时，当我真正注视书籍本身，才逐渐理解它们的珍贵。」
    >
    > 他搭在我肩上的手收紧了。「这里的藏书以针鼹、海妖之皮装帧，更有甚者采用早已灭绝的巨兽皮——那些研究它们的学者多半认为，除化石外已无迹可寻。我们有以未知合金通体包覆的书，有封面镶满密匝宝石的书。有裹在香木中的典籍，其木材穿越造物间不可想象的鸿沟而来——它们因尘世无人能解而倍显珍贵。」
    >
    > 「有些书的纸张混入奇异的植物生物碱，翻页之际，读者会猝不及防地坠入荒诞幻想与离奇梦境。有些书页根本非纸所制，而是白玉、象牙与贝壳的纤薄切片；更有以未知植物的枯叶为页的奇书。还有些典籍看似与书毫无关联：卷轴、泥板，以及镌刻于百种奇异材质上的记录。此处有枚水晶立方——尽管我已无法指明所在——它不比你拇指关节大，却囊括了超越整个图书馆的典籍。纵使妓女可将其悬于耳际作饰，世间亦无足够书卷平衡另一端。」
    >
    > 「当我知晓这一切，守护它们便成了我毕生的使命。」（译注：我没看过，这是 DeepSeek 翻译的）

<!-- Gene Wolfe says that he writes for an educated reader^[The irony of course being that Wolfe's allusions and discourse range so widely that one would have to be a pansophist or have the same personal library in order to follow each reference and perceive the whole pattern.]: -->

吉恩·沃尔夫说，他的写作面向受过教育的读者^[讽刺的是，沃尔夫的典故与论述范围如此广泛，读者必须是通才，或拥有同等规模的个人图书馆，才能领会所有指涉并感知整体脉络]：

<!-- > "My definition of good literature is that which can be read by an educated reader, and reread with increased pleasure."^[["The Wolfe & Gaiman Show"](https://www.locusmag.com/2002/Issue09/GaimanWolfe.html), _[Locus Online](!W)_] -->

> 我对优秀文学的定义是：受过教育的读者能从中获得乐趣，且重读时乐趣倍增。^[["The Wolfe & Gaiman Show"](https://www.locusmag.com/2002/Issue09/GaimanWolfe.html), *[Locus Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(magazine)#Locus_Online)*]

<!-- Regardless of where Wolfe's true greatness lies, reading him inculcates an active mindset. In normal fiction, one passively consumes the interpretations and descriptions of the narrator. With Wolfe's unreliable narrators, this is impossible. Reading normal fiction with a Wolfean mindset sometimes leads to interesting results. I'd like to show a personal example. -->

无论沃尔夫的伟大之处究竟何在，阅读他的作品都会培养一种主动思维。在普通小说中，读者被动接受叙述者的解读与描述。而面对沃尔夫笔下不可靠的叙述者，这种被动变得不可能。用沃尔夫式的思维阅读普通小说时，有时会产生有趣的结果。容我分享一个亲身案例。

# 《凉宫春日的忧郁》

<!-- Some time ago, in 2006, a short high school drama/comedy anime was released called _[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](!W)_. (Yes, *another* one.) It was based on a popular [light novel](!W) series of the same name, and it became the most popular anime of the year, an instant classic. -->

2006 年，一部名为《[凉宫春日的忧郁](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B6%BC%E5%AE%AE%E6%98%A5%E6%97%A5%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97#%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E5%8B%95%E7%95%AB)》的高中校园喜剧动画短片问世（是的，**又一部**同类作品）。它改编自同名热门[轻小说](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%BC%95%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AA)系列，一经推出就成为当年最受欢迎的动画，跻身经典之列。

<!-- ## Plot -->

## 情节

<!-- The basic plot goes that Kyon, our skeptical but solid ordinary^[I mean this in the sense of socially-well-adjusted, and *not* nerdy or [otaku](!W). Many high school anime have 'ordinary joes' who are actually unusual (in the same way that hardcore anime watchers are unusual). If everyone you hang out with resembles the cast of _[Genshiken](!W)_, it can be easy to mistake what I mean by 'ordinary' in an anime context like this.] guy, has just started high school. When the members of his new class introduce themselves^[Japanese high schools are not like American high schools in this respect; classes stay together as they rotate through the subjects.], one attractive girl sitting in front of Kyon (the eponymous Haruhi) makes the declaration that she seeks interesting & unusual beings such as "aliens, time travelers, ghosts, demons, ESPers". She's a weirdo. -->

基本剧情是这样的：我们那位多疑但实在的普通小伙^[此处的「普通」指社交能力良好，**而非**书呆子或[御宅族](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BE%A1%E5%AE%85%E6%97%8F)。许多高中动画中所谓的「普通人」其实很特殊（像硬核动画迷那样特殊）。若你周围的人都像「[现视研](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%8F%BE%E8%A6%96%E7%A0%94)」的角色，可能误解我在此类动画语境中「普通」的含义]阿虚，刚升入高中。新生自我介绍环节中^[日本高中班级制度与美国不同：学生以固定班级为单位流动上课]，坐在阿虚前排的漂亮女孩（即标题人物凉宫春日）宣布要寻找「外星人、未来人、幽灵、恶魔、超能力者」^[译注：我没理解这个幽灵和恶魔指的是啥，下同]等有趣又异常的存在。她是个怪人。

<!-- Kyon is interested in her anyway, and eventually offhandedly suggests that she form a club for such beings. She takes him up on it, and applying the trademark Haruhi brand of arrogance, slyness, and impetuosity, rounds up 3 members besides herself and Kyon: Mikuru, a buxom red-headed upperclassmen; Itsuki, who likes to egg on Haruhi; and Yuki, a small quiet girl who is always reading. -->

阿虚还是对她产生了兴趣，并随口提议她成立一个搜寻这种存在的社团。她立刻采纳了这个主意，并以她标志性的傲慢、狡黠与冲动，除自己和阿虚之外又招揽了三名成员：棕发巨乳学姐朝比奈实玖瑠；热衷煽动春日的古泉一树；以及总在安静读书的娇小少女长门有希。

<!-- As they go about their random club activities dictated by Haruhi, Kyon is startled to discover that each of the other club members is such a being as Haruhi desired^[More or less; Yuki is a robot/AI, which counts as an alien; Itsuki Koizumi is an ESPer, but only in sub-dimensions that sporadically appear; and Mikuru is a time traveler, though she only seems to make 2 trips. There don't seem to be any ghosts or demons in the cast.]; and that further, the reason for this is that Haruhi is in fact the god who created and controls the universe he lives in. As she is entirely unaware of her true nature & powers, her primary focus is on having fun as a schoolgirl; the 3 uncanny beings have set their face on granting Haruhi her wish, and have enlisted Kyon in the mission. -->

当社团成员们执行春日心血来潮的活动时，阿虚震惊地发现其他成员竟都是春日追寻的目标^[大致如此：有希是机器人/人工智能，属于外星人范畴；古泉一树是超能力者，但能力仅限于偶尔出现的闭锁空间（译注：原文「sub-dimensions」，下同）；实玖瑠则是时间旅行者，但似乎只进行过两次穿越。目前看来并无幽灵或恶魔登场。]；更惊人的是，这一切的根源在于春日正是创造并掌控宇宙的神明。她完全不知道自己的本质和力量，所以主要精力都放在享受女高生活上；三位异常存在决心实现春日的愿望，并将阿虚也拉入了这项使命。

<!-- Haruhi, though a [tsundere](!W)^[Haruhi is one of the paradigmatic _tsundere_ characters; consider a quote from episode 1: "Feelings of love are just a temporary lapse in judgment. Like a mental illness."], begins to fall in love with Kyon, and vice versa. At the end of the season, she feels rejected by Kyon in favor of Mikuru, and begins to destroy the world in favor of a new & more satisfying one, but Kyon manages to convince her that he returns her affection and he preferred the old world. -->

春日虽是个[傲娇](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%82%B2%E5%AC%8C)^[春日是典型的**傲娇**角色。试看第一集台词：「所谓的恋爱感情，不过是一时内心被迷惑而已，可以说只是一种精神病」（译注：译文出自 09 版第四集）]，却逐渐对阿虚萌生爱意，反之亦然。本季结尾时，她觉得阿虚抛弃了她而更偏向实玖瑠，于是开始摧毁世界以期创造更满意的新世界。所幸阿虚成功说服她：他同样怀有情愫，且更眷恋原有世界。

<!-- ！台词 -->

<!-- ### Sequence -->

### 顺序

<!-- One unique aspect of _Haruhi_ is that there are 2 orders in which to play the episodes. The first is the sequence in which it was broadcast, the 'Haruhi' sequence. This sequence jumps around - for example, the first episode is an indie movie made for the school's [Japanese Cultural Festival](!W), which chronologically belongs toward the end of the series. The second is the logical, chronological order ('Kyon' order). -->

《凉宫春日》的独特之处在于存在两种剧集播放顺序。第一种是原始播送顺序，即「春日顺序」。该顺序是跳跃式的。例如，第一集是为校园[文化祭](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E7%A5%AD)制作的独立电影，按时间线应该在系列结尾。第二种是符合逻辑的时间顺序（「阿虚顺序」）。

<!-- The reason for the Haruhi order is that the original series was 14 episodes. So the creators ([Kyoto Animation](!W)) had to draw on material from multiple books. But each light novel is structured normally: beginning, middle, climax, end. The series would feel a little odd to have multiple arcs, cutting out in the middle. Their solution was to focus on the story arc of the first light novel, which culminates in Haruhi and Kyon's first kiss, and leave that as the *last* episode (Haruhi order). What was to be done with all the episodes that chronologically would come after the kiss? They simply stuck them into the beginning and middle! -->

采用春日顺序的原因是原系列仅有 14 集。制作公司[京都动画](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E5%8B%95%E7%95%AB)必须整合多卷小说素材，但每卷轻小说都有正常的结构：开端、发展、高潮、结局。若剧情包含多个故事，又在中间切断，会显得有点突兀。他们的解决方案是以首卷轻小说的故事线为核心——该线以春日与阿虚的初吻为高潮——并将其作为**最终集**（春日顺序）。那么，时间线上位于初吻之后的剧集如何处理？直接插入前中期即可！

<!-- So the Haruhi order keeps the story arc over the 14 episodes intact, which provides a real ending (a good & rare thing; see my [discussion of compromises in anime adaptation endings](/death-note-ending "'Death Note’s Ending', Branwen 2008")), and also accomplishes a number of neat things: it's original; it provides foreshadowing; it involves the viewer in trying to understand and piece together the plot; and it renders scenes freshly poignant or just *different* the second time around. -->

因此春日顺序保持了 14 集故事线的完整性，提供了真正的结局（实属难得佳作。参阅我对[动画改编结局妥协性的探讨](https://gwern.net/death-note-ending "'Death Note’s Ending', Branwen 2008")），同时实现了许多巧妙设计：新颖独创，埋设伏笔，引导观众理解和拼凑剧情，并使场景在二刷时焕发新意或呈现**截然不同**的观感。

<!-- You can understand why I slipped into Wolfe-mode watching _Haruhi_. -->

此刻你便能理解，为何观看《凉宫春日》时我会不自觉地陷入沃尔夫模式。

<!-- ## Problems -->

## 问题

<!-- The inner story in Wolfe is manifested most often in lies, inconsistencies, or peculiarities of characters. Characters act in realistic ways, pursuing their goals in a rational fashion. They eat, defecate, sleep, and so on, in a precise timeline. Wolfe makes it a point of pride to have few accidental errors. When you notice an error or wonder why a character did something so round-about, Wolfe is gesturing toward the real story. -->

沃尔夫作品中潜藏的故事，最常通过角色的谎言、矛盾或异常行为显现。角色以现实的方式行动，理性地追求目标。他们遵循精确的时间线进食、排泄、睡眠等。沃尔夫以极少出现意外错误为傲。当你注意到某个矛盾，或困惑于角色为何迂回行事时，那正是沃尔夫在暗示着真实的故事。

<!-- ### Timing -->

### 时间

<!-- The second time through, I noticed something odd about the setup. The other characters tell Kyon that they've existed and have been observing Haruhi for 3 years at that point. -->

二刷时，我注意到设定存在异常。其他角色告诉阿虚：他们已存在并监视春日三年了。

<!-- Isn't there something strange about this? 3 years and they haven't made contact themselves; nor has Haruhi subconsciously forced them to take action that might interest her. For that matter, isn't it a little strange that Haruhi might create such creatures and *not know* about them? How is it interesting or fun to live in a world with time travelers and aliens and ESPers if one doesn't know of them *at all*? If they aren't even doing anything unusual or affecting daily life? Haruhi's life seems to be precisely as boring & melancholy after their creation as it was before. -->

这难道不奇怪吗？整整三年间，他们未曾主动接触；春日也未曾下意识使他们采取任何她感兴趣的行动。更蹊跷的是，春日既创造了这些存在，却如何**浑然不知**？若对时间旅行者、外星人与超能力者的存在**一无所知**，这样的世界谈何有趣？甚至这些存在既不展现异常，也不影响日常生活？春日的世界在创造前后似乎同样无聊、忧郁。

<!-- A further problem is that [Haruhi tells Kyon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE-qmHdZIKU) a story of [existential](!W "existentialism") [angst](!W) from her childhood: -->

更深层的问题在于，[春日向阿虚讲述](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE-qmHdZIKU)了她童年的[存在主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)[焦虑](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%95%8F)：

<!-- > "I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him, "Do you know how many people are here right now"? He said since the stadium was full, probably fifty thousand...I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all." -->

> 「简直令人以为全日本的人一个不剩地都集中在这个空间里了。于是我问了老爸：『这里到底有多少人？』老爸回答我说：『已经坐满了，所以大概有五万人左右吧。』……我不过是那球场中那么多人中的一个而已，而球场中令人觉得已经有很多的人，却也仅仅是所有人中的一点点。在那之前，我一直认为自己是在某一点上有特别之处的人。和家人在一起很开心。特别是我所上的学校，我所在的班级，我一直认为那是由世界上最有趣的一群人组成的。但是那时我终于注意到并非如此。班上发生的我认为是世界上最有趣的事，也只不过是在日本各处的学校中都发生过很多遍的小事而已。从日本全国人的角度看来，只不过是很普通的事而已。」^[译注：译文出自 09 版第五集]

<!-- ！台词 -->

<!-- She then vowed to make life interesting. But this was during *middle* school. Why then does life only become interesting in *high* school, 3 years later? The timeframe seems more than a little odd. -->

于是她发誓要让生活变得有趣。但这发生在**初中**时期。为何生活直到**高中**——三年后——才变得有趣？这个时间框架似乎有些奇怪。

<!-- Haruhi may've acted weird - her classmates note that she had a reputation even in middle school - but Yuki specifically tells Kyon that in those 3 years, nothing peculiar or godly occurred^["I have been doing this since I was born 3 years ago. In the last 3 years, no particularly unusual elements were discovered, and things were very stable. However, recently an external factor has now appeared beside Suzumiya Haruhi that cannot be ignored." Chapter 3, Book 1]. Are we to believe that Haruhi spent 3 years desperately seeking out freaks and oddballs and ESPers and sliders^[Kyon is not particularly interested in "sliders". Curiously, sliders along with ghosts & demons, are one of the categories of people who have not yet appeared despite Haruhi's interest in them. It is possible that Kyon is the token slider due to _Disappearance_ (although the 'other' world is just our world which has been altered), or Haruhi's alternate personality [Yasumi Watahashi](https://haruhi.fandom.com/wiki/Haruhi_Suzumiya#Yasumi_Watahashi) in _Dissociation_, or that a slider was planned for a later novel. If none of those are true, it raises the interesting possibility that sliders never appear because *Kyon* himself just isn't that interested in them, unlike the other categories.] and anything unusual, and her powers just refused to supply anything *at all*?
This when her mere whim in later years are supposedly enough to make cats talk, and when her previous desires had conjured ESPers out of nothingness? -->

春日或许行为怪异——同学提到她早在初中就名声在外——但有希明确告知阿虚：那三年间未发生任何奇怪或神圣的事情^[「打从我出生这三年来都一直这样度过。这三年里，并没有发现什么特别的不确定因素，非常地稳定。可是，最近却发现凉宫春日身边出现了许多不容忽视的异常因子。」第一卷第三章]。难道我们要相信，春日耗费三年拼命搜寻怪胎、异类、超能力者和异世界人^[阿虚对「异世界人」兴趣寥寥。耐人寻味的是，与幽灵和恶魔类似，这类存在虽受春日关注却从未现身。可能性包括：《消失》中阿虚因进入被篡改的「另一世界」成为象征性穿越者；《分裂》中春日的另一个人格[渡桥泰水](https://haruhi.fandom.com/wiki/Haruhi_Suzumiya#Yasumi_Watahashi)；或后续小说计划登场的穿越者。若皆不成立，则暗示更惊人的可能：这类角色缺席正是因为**阿虚**本人对其缺乏兴趣，与其他类别截然不同]以及任何异常，而她的神力却**完全无法**提供帮助？要知道在后期，她一时兴起就足以让猫开口说话，先前更能凭空创造出超能力者？

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- Nothing interesting happened during those 3 years... but something interesting happened at the beginning of those 3 years. Kyon from the future appeared one Tanabata night and ran into contemporary middle-school Haruhi, and assisted her in her crop circle. This was a day noted by all the paranormal observers. Then Kyon left the timeline, returning to after 3 years in the future - which had been the point at which "Haruhi's" powers began manifesting again. An interesting set of timings, wouldn't one say? A remarkable coincidence that whatever suppressed Haruhi's powers just happened to span the same time interval as her separation from Kyon. -->

这三年间毫无波澜……但三年的开头发生了趣事。未来的阿虚现身于某个七夕之夜，邂逅初中时期的春日，协助她完成了麦田怪圈。这一天被所有超自然观察者记录在案。随后阿虚脱离时间线，返回三年后的未来——恰逢「春日的」能力再度显现的起点。多么有趣的时间对应，不是吗？压制春日能力的因素竟然恰好覆盖了她与阿虚分离的时期，堪称非凡的巧合。

<!-- Another curious point is that the evidence of Haruhi's divine nature is so meager. The 'Data Integration Entity' (a massive AI apparently modeled after the TechnoCore from [Dan Simmons's](!W "Dan Simmons") _[Hyperion Cantos](!W)_^[The Data Integration Entity has factions which conflict on how to handle Haruhi, similar to the TechnoCore's conflicts over whether to create the ultimate machine intelligence/god, the AI characters Yuki/Asakura/etc are reminiscent of the John Keats "cybrid" character, and a translated copy of _[The Fall of Hyperion](!W "The Fall of Hyperion (novel)")_ being read by Yuki Nagato features prominently early on and during _The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya_ (alluded to in the LN as "Nagato Yuki was in her usual spot, reading a hardback book about a [minor satellite of Saturn](!W "Hyperion (moon)") falling down, or something like that." and shown more explicitly in the anime).]) says only that Haruhi is at the center of the anomalies^["The information sparks emitted from a certain area in the bow-shaped archipelago instantly covered the whole planet and started to spread towards outer space. And the center of all that is Suzumiya Haruhi." Chapter 3, Book 1]. Yuki also tells Kyon that "For 3 years, I have gone through all sorts of investigations on the individual known as Suzumiya Haruhi from all perspectives, but up to now I was still unable to discover her true identity."^[Chapter 3, Book 1], and that the whole 'data explosion' is 'impossible to analyze'. So Haruhi being godlike may be a good guess - but from the AI perspective, it's just a guess. -->

另一耐人寻味的点在于，证明春日神明特质的证据极为薄弱。「资讯统合思念体」（一个明显借鉴自[{丹·西蒙斯|Dan Simmons}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos)《[{海伯利安|Hyperion Cantos}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos)》中技术内核的庞大 AI^[该组织内部派系对处置春日的方式存在分歧，类似技术内核关于是否创造终极机器智能/神的争论；长门、朝仓等 AI 角色令人联想到{约翰·济慈|John Keats}的「cybrid」（译注：没看过海伯利安，不知道这是啥）设定；且长门有希阅读的《[{海伯利安的陨落|The Fall of Hyperion}](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%B7%E4%BC%AF%E5%88%A9%E5%AE%89%E7%9A%84%E9%99%A8%E8%90%BD)》译本在早期及《凉宫春日的消失》中占据重要地位（小说以「长门有希依旧坐在她的老位子上，专心看着标题为[土星卫星](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9C%9F%E5%8D%AB%E4%B8%83)要是掉下来会怎么样的厚重精装书」（译注：译文出自第一卷第二章）隐晦提及，动画则更直白呈现）]）仅宣称春日是异常现象的中心^[「从弓状列岛某一区域所喷射出来的资讯火花，瞬间覆盖了整颗行星，并朝行星外的空间扩散。而中心点就是凉宫春日。」第一卷第三章]。有希亦告知阿虚：「这三年来，我从各种角度针对凉宫春日这个个体进行调查，但直到现在还是无法掌握她的确实身份」^[第一卷第三章]，且整个「数据爆发」都是「无法解析」的。因此将春日视为神明或许是个合理推测——但对 AI 而言，这终究只是推测。

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- Itsuki and the ESPers are little more help. They fight various sub-dimensions whose appearances are correlated with emotional disturbances in Haruhi - but correlation is not causation.^[Particularly not here. If the ESPers can observe Haruhi's emotional distress - which they must be able to, in order to notice the correlation - so could someone else. For an outside observer, it's hard to tell the difference between a causal sequence like 'A → C', and 'A → B → C'.] -->

一树及超能力组织也帮助有限。他们对抗的各种闭锁空间虽与春日的情绪波动相关，但相关性不等于因果性。^[此处尤甚。若超能力者能观测春日的情绪波动（他们必须能观测才可发现关联），其他人同样可能观测到。对外部观察者而言，很难区分「A → C」与「A → B → C」这类因果链。]

<!-- The time travelers as represented by Mikuru, are even less help. She speaks only of a barrier in time, and has little justification for believing Haruhi god. -->

以实玖瑠为代表的时间旅行者则更是毫无帮助。她仅提及「时间断层」的存在，对春日是神明的论断同样缺乏有力依据。

<!-- ### Minimal Power -->

### 能力悬殊

<!-- Indeed, the other characters manifest far more power than Haruhi: -->

事实上，其他角色展现的力量远超春日：

<!-- - Nagato can create and break into sub-dimensions and do nearly arbitrary things there

     - she has [1337](!W "leet") hacking skill
     - she can also modify ordinary objects like baseball bats to have extraordinary powers.
- Itsuki becomes a superhero in sub-dimensions, able to fly and shoot energy.
- Mikuru as a time traveler can have future selves show up and render aid (in addition to any future weaponry, which she may or may not possess). -->

- 长门能创造并侵入亚空间^[译注：原文「sub-dimensions」，下同）]，在其中进行几乎任何操作

    - 拥有顶级^[译注：原文「[1337](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet)」]黑客技术
    - 可将棒球棍等普通物品改造为具备非凡力量的道具
- 一树在闭锁空间化身超级英雄，能飞行并发射能量
- 实玖瑠作为时间旅行者，能让未来的自己出现并提供帮助（可能持有未来武器，也可能没有）

<!-- What does Haruhi do? Well, there are the sub-dimensions filled with rampaging monsters. (But that's not clearly Haruhi's doing.) There is a mysterious shadow on the desert island as they leave. (But that's not much.) Some birds changing color are supposed to be her work. And... I am sure there are other things, but they are not quite coming to mind. -->

春日做了什么？嗯，有那些充斥肆虐巨人的闭锁空间（但这未必是春日的作为），离岛时出现的神秘阴影（同样微不足道），某些鸟类变色据称也是她的手笔。以及……我确信还有其他事例，但一时想不起来了。

<!-- And for that matter, all the powers seem to center around someone else. For example, the mysterious shadow on the island is not spotted by Haruhi but by Kyon and Itsuki. Likewise the white birds. Shamisen the talking cat talks only to Kyon, after Haruhi has left the scene. -->

说到底，所有力量似乎都围绕着其他人。例如，岛上的神秘阴影的发现者并非春日，而是阿虚与一树。白鸟变色事件同理。会说话的三味线猫也只在春日离场后向阿虚开口。

<!-- ### The God that Failed -->

### 失败的神明{#the-god-that-failed}

<!-- Haruhi is often defeated or set back: -->

春日屡屡失败或受阻：

<!-- - Founding the club, she is swiftly prevented from advertising it while wearing a [Playboy bunny](!W) suit.
- She is prevented by Kyon from placing skimpily-clad photos of Mikuru on the club website.^["I quickly warned her about the dangers of putting personal details on the web, and amazingly for once, Haruhi actually paid attention and listened to me seriously...She then very reluctantly allowed me to remove the images from the page." Chapter 3, Book 1]
- In episode 5, while drawing lots for wandering about the city and looking for strange events to investigate, Haruhi twice gets the wrong stick and so isn't paired off with Kyon. This deeply angers her. But what sort of god can't influence a random draw even when she really wants to?
- Haruhi is completely cut out of the one truly mysterious case Kyon & the club investigates, the computer club president's disappearance.
- In the desert island episode 06, Haruhi suggests that there be a murder mystery, and in particular, that the master murder Mikuru. Kyon vetoes it. Nothing happens to Mikuru.

    Indeed, in both desert island episodes, Haruhi's detective skills and wishing fail. No real murders happen, and certainly not the way she suggested. And Kyon solves it.
- When filming the movie for the student cultural festival, Haruhi insists that Koizumi kiss Mikuru (the two protagonists); Kyon stops it^[Chapter 6, Book 2].
- in _Disappearance_, Haruhi's powers are stripped from her entirely and all the supernatural phenomena she is interested in are removed from her world, frustrating her chief desire; this is surely a major defeat for her, although she doesn't realize it. The regular world is ultimately restored by the decision of Kyon. -->

- 创立社团后，她穿上[兔女郎装](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%94%E5%A5%B3%E9%83%8E)的宣传被迅速阻止。
- 阿虚制止了她在社团网站发布实玖瑠的暴露照片。^[「我立刻开始警告她在网路上刊载个人资讯的危险性，而春日竟异常难得地认真望着我……接着，才心不甘情不愿地同意我把所有档案拿掉。」第一卷第三章]
- 第五集中，抽签分组调查不可思议的现象时，春日两次抽错签而未能与阿虚同组，并为此勃然大怒。但什么样的神明会在强烈渴望时，连随机抽签都无法影响？
- 在阿虚与 SOS 团调查的唯一真正神秘的案件——电脑社长失踪案中，春日全程被排除在外。
- 孤岛篇第六集，春日提议上演谋杀谜案，并特别要求凶手杀害实玖瑠。阿虚否决该提案后，实玖瑠安然无恙。

  事实上，在孤岛篇的两集中，春日的侦探能力与愿望双双落空。真正的谋杀并未发生，更没有按她设想的方式展开。而且最终破案者是阿虚。
- 拍摄学园祭电影时，春日坚持要古泉亲吻实玖瑠（两位主角）；阿虚阻止了这场戏。^[第二卷第六章]
- 《消失》中，春日的能力被彻底剥夺，她感兴趣的超自然现象尽数从世界抹除，使其核心愿望落空。这无疑是重大挫败，尽管她并未意识到。最终，常规世界由阿虚的决定恢复了。

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- When does Kyon really fail? (Indeed, Haruhi's list of defeats is almost as much a list of Kyon getting his way.) -->

那么，阿虚何时真正失败过？（事实上，春日这份受挫清单，几乎等同于阿虚如愿以偿的清单。）

<!-- ## The Real Story -->

## 真相

<!-- > I used to read often. When I was in elementary school, my mom used to borrow illustrated books from the children's book section for me to read. There were all sorts of books, but I remember that all the ones I'd read were quite interesting. However, I can't remember any of their names anymore. When did I stop reading? When did reading start becoming boring for me?

> 我以前常常看书。小学低年级的时候，妈妈常在图书馆的小朋友专区借书给我看。虽然各种类型的都有，但印象中看到的都很有趣。不过到底看过什么却不记得了。我是从什么时候开始不看书的？是从何时开始觉得看书很无趣的呢？

<!-- So we may be convinced by now that something is going on. (Or we may not be; plausibly, each of these could be explained by something like an error, a consequence of time travel, or artistic license etc.) -->

至此我们或许已经确信事有蹊跷。（也可能仍存疑，毕竟每条异常都能解释成错误、时间旅行的后果、创作自由等）。

<!-- But what is the real story? It could be anything, from what really happened to who characters really are. In Wolfe, though, deception tends to focus on characters and issues of identity. In _Peace_, Weer is not what you think he is. In _The Book of the New Sun_, characters like Dorcas are not who they appear to be^[Dorcas appears to be a random young woman Severian saves and sleeps with; in fact, she was resurrected by Severian. And she's his grandmother.]. So what character should we be most suspicious of? -->

但真相究竟是什么？可能性众多——从真实事件到角色身份皆可存疑。在沃尔夫的作品中，欺骗往往聚焦于角色身份问题：《Peace》中的 Weer 并非表象；《The Book of the New Sun》里 Dorcas 等角色同样身份成谜^[Dorcas 表面上只是被 Severian 偶然拯救并与之同眠的年轻女子，实则是被他复活的祖母]。那么，我们最应该怀疑谁？

<!-- > "This is what I think," Koizumi continued to ramble on, "Someone granted Suzumiya-san omnipotent god-like powers, yet they did not allow her to become aware of it. If there were a God, then Suzumiya-san would be the person chosen by God. But no matter how you look at it, she's just a normal person."
>
> I didn't have to think a lot on whether that girl's a normal person or not. But why did Haruhi have such omnipotent power that she's unaware of? Enough power to turn pigeon feathers white. Why? Who was behind this?
>
> "Well, I also don't know; do you?"^[Chapter 4, Book 2] -->

> 「我是这样想的，」古泉迳自喋喋不休地讲着：「有人赐与凉宫同学足以与神媲美的能力，但是她并没有获赐那种自觉。如果说真有神的存在，那么凉宫同学正是由神所遴选出来的人。她彻头彻尾是个凡人。」
>
> 那家伙究竟是不是个凡人，我根本不想思考。但是春日为什么会有那种无意识的神力和足以让鸽子变成白色的能力呢？因为什么？因为谁？
>
> 「这个嘛，我也不清楚。你知道吗？」^[第二册第四章]

<!-- ### Why Kyon? -->

### 为何是阿虚？

<!-- > 'What's wrong with that? So you're saying if the movie ends in such an unresolved way, this reality would be permanently distorted and become the new reality? Haruhi must have an ending in mind, and it must be an ending that is in line with reality. This is a problem that we must consider, as Haruhi would never consider such stuff, and even if she does, it would only end in disaster. So it's still better for us to do the thinking. But why must we think of such stuff? Isn't there someone else that can carry this cursed burden for us?
>
> "If he even exists, then yes."
>
> Koizumi shrugged his shoulders, "I believe he would have appeared before us long ago if he existed. So we must find a solution as soon as possible, especially you. I look forward to seeing you work harder."'^[Chapter 5, Book 2] -->

> 这样有什么不好吗，照你所说的，如果电影就这样以半调子的状况结束的话，这个即将崩坏的现实就会定形成现实吗？春日心里必须有个结局，而且必须是符合现实状况的结局，而这是我们必须去考虑的问题，春日是不会考虑这种事的，而且那家伙思考的事情往往只会造成毁灭的下场。既然如此，还是由我们来思考会比较好一点，但是我们为什么非得考虑这种事情不可？难道就没有哪个人可以来帮我们承担这个咒语吗？
>
> 「要是有那种人存在的话，」
>
> 古泉耸耸肩。
>
> 「我想早就出现在我们面前了吧？所以我们必须想办法解决才行。尤其是你，我期待你能更加把劲。」^[第二卷第五章]

<!-- If Haruhi is not the god, then who is (s)he? -->

如果春日并非神明，那么谁是？

<!-- I believe the god is really Kyon. We are expected to swallow the thesis that the god of this fictional universe is ignorant of its identity, and wouldn't that describe Kyon as well as Haruhi? What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. All throughout the series, Kyon is as much of an anomaly as Haruhi. We are told this quite directly: -->

我认为神明实为阿虚。我们被期望接受「这个虚构宇宙的神明不自知身份」的论点——但这一描述岂不同样适用于阿虚？应该一视同仁。纵观整个系列，阿虚与春日同样异常。这一点被直接点明：

> 最大的谜团是你。
>
> ——古泉，对阿虚^[译注：译文出自 09 版第三集]

<!-- ！台词 -->

<!-- Even bigger than Haruhi, eh? As well, Kyon is one of the 2 people who has not "shown me honest proof of their identity". -->

比凉宫春日更神秘的存在？此外，阿虚是唯二没有「向我展示真实身份证明」的人之一。

<!-- Kyon *claims* to be an ordinary high school student, and the other characters constantly tell Kyon how normal he is - but he's much like Haruhi. In the introduction, he tells us that he was once obsessed with the same subjects as Haruhi - but he gave them up on entering high school (that is, 3 years ago, while in middle school).[^giving-up] He *claims* to dislike the adventures and be stressed out, and this is the public image put forth in things like his [image songs](!W "Image song")[^image], but actions speak far louder than words; Kyon has never had to be seriously forced into club activities. His reluctance is only feigned. -->

阿虚**自称**是普通高中生，其他角色也不断强调他的平凡——但这与春日的处境非常相似。开篇自述中，他说自己曾痴迷于与春日相同的超自然话题，却在升入高中时放弃了这些追求（即三年前的初中阶段）。[^giving-up]他**声称**自己厌恶冒险且倍感压力，这种形象也在其[角色歌](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A7%92%E8%89%B2%E6%AD%8C%E6%9B%B2)[^image]等公开作品中塑造，但行动远胜于言辞：阿虚从未真正被强迫参与社团活动，他的抗拒不过是伪装。

<!-- [^giving-up]: Kyon; Prologue, Book 1:

     > "I couldn't help but get depressed at how normal the laws of physics were. I began to stop watching for UFOs and paying attention to paranormal TV shows because I finally convinced myself it was impossible. I even reached a point where I only had a sense of nostalgia for those things.
     >
     > After junior high, I completely grew out of that fantasy world and became utterly grounded in reality." -->

我们已经知道，阿虚曾怀有或仍怀有此类期待，并且最终屈服于常识。而他加入了 SOS 团并在朝仓凉子的现实篡改刺杀中幸存，这两件事都很离奇。需要注意，此批评**不适用**于「虚神」：他非常清楚这些实体的存在！

<!-- Many of the otherwise peculiar events become explicable when considered from a Kyon-_[kami](!W)_ perspective. -->

许多看似奇怪的事件，若从「虚[神](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E_(%E7%A5%9E%E9%81%93))论」视角来看，就能合理解释。

<!-- The curious 3 year gap where nothing at all curious happened? Kyon had vowed that high school would be different, until, of course, he realized how bored and depressed he was.[^hill] -->

那怪异的三年空白期，为何毫无异常发生？因为阿虚曾经发誓高中要变得不同，直到他意识到自己依然深陷无聊与抑郁[^hill]。

<!-- [^hill]: volume 1 tells us Kyon's melancholy was - ostensibly - due to having to climb a hill:

    > And so, I entered the senior high school in my area. At first, I regretted this decision as my new school sat on top of a very high hill. Even during spring, students would become hot and sweaty just from climbing the steep road - clearly, my intention of "going to school leisurely" was not going to work. Every time I remembered this, along with the fact that I would have to repeat the same procedure every day for the next three years, I became tired and depressed. I overslept a bit today. Perhaps that's why I walked so much faster, and perhaps that was why I was so tired then. I could have woken up ten minutes earlier, but, as all of you know, you sleep best right before it's time to get up. I didn't want to waste that precious 10 minutes, so I gave up on the thought, which meant that I would need to repeat this early exercise for the next three years. This was just too depressing. -->

[^hill]: 第一卷提及，阿虚的忧郁表面上是因为不得不爬坡：

    > 之后，我就这么糊里糊涂地进入学区内的县立高中就读。起初我还很后悔。因为这座学校位在很高的山上，就算是春天也要挥汗如雨地爬上直窜山顶的坡道，想轻松健行的那份悠闲早已消失无踪。一想到今后三年每天一大早都得这样爬山，我的心情就阴郁无比。或许是早上差点睡过头的关系，走路的速度自然加快许多。虽然也曾想过以后干脆早十分钟起床，慢慢走去上学就不会这么累，不过一想到临起床前的那十分钟睡眠是多么的宝贵，我随即放弃了这个念头。所以。我相信未来的三年还是得持续这个晨间的运动。一想到这里。心情就更沉重了。（译注：译文出自第一卷第一章）

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- Nagato's observation that nothing unusual had happened during those 3 years, until high school started (and Kyon was around)?
Unlike Kyon, she was fully bored and waiting for, something, anything, interesting to happen (like the return of John Smith); yet - nothing happened.
But explained, if Haruhi has no powers: she was bored during those years and wasn't deferring anything to the mythical 'rose-colored life' of high school, but *Kyon* was. -->

长门观察到，那三年间毫无异常，直到高中开学（阿虚出现）？不同于阿虚，她无比无聊地等待着任何有趣之事发生（比如约翰·史密斯的回归）；然而——无事发生。但若春日并无神力，此现象就能解释：这些年她本就百无聊赖，并未将期望寄托于传说中高中的「玫瑰色生活」——真正心怀期待的是**阿虚**。  

<!-- The desert island incident? Kyon didn't want there to be any *real* murders, but he was still interested. Witness his constant conversation and thinking on the topic. He is also the one who solves the mystery, and suspected the answer from the start. Is this combination of knowing the answer, being involved, and having fun really consistent with the Haruhi-_kami_ hypothesis? The shadow at the end, one says? A gift from Kyon to a disappointed Haruhi; we never hear of anything happening on that island thereafter (an [argument from silence](!W) which is more consistent with Kyon-_kami_ than Haruhi-_kami_). -->

孤岛事件？阿虚不愿发生**真正**的谋杀，却仍然兴致盎然。请看他全程围绕着该话题的交谈与思考。他也是破解谜案的人，且从一开始就怀疑真相。这种知晓答案、深度参与又乐在其中的状态，真的符合「凉神论」吗？至于结尾的阴影？不妨视为阿虚赠予失望春日的礼物；此后该岛再未传出异闻（这一[默证](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%98%E8%AD%89)较之「凉神论」，更吻合「虚神论」的逻辑）。

<!-- In the universe of _Haruhi_, the answer for the [theodicy](!W) is that God is human and is imperfect. Further, it is capable of the usual range of emotions: every character plausibly suggested to be God can apparently evince pleasure, anger, shame, etc. Thus, it is possible that this god might create a creature to do what he'd be too embarrassed to do. In this light, we must ask '[cui bono](!W)?' when it comes to Haruhi's treatment of Mikuru Asahina's body and Haruhi's own exhibitionism[^bunny] -->

在《凉宫春日》宇宙中，对[神义论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B9%89%E8%AE%BA)的回答是：神明是人类，且不完美。更甚者，祂具备常人的情感范围：任何被推测为神的角色都能展现喜悦、愤怒、羞耻等情绪。因此，这位神明可能创造出代理者，来做祂自己感到尴尬的事。由此视角，我们必须追问「[谁受益](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cui_bono%3F)？」，尤其当审视春日对待朝比奈实玖瑠身体的方式及其暴露癖[^bunny]时。

<!-- [^bunny]: The bunny suits have been mentioned already. More pointed is one custom of Haruhi (Chapter 1, Book 1):

    > "Clue #2: For PE, classes 1-5 and 1-6 would combine and take it together, with the boys and girls separated. When we changed clothes, the girls would go to the 1-5 classroom, and the boys would go to the 1-6 classroom; meaning at the end of the previous period, the guys from our class (1-5) would move to the other room to change.
    >
    > Unfortunately, Haruhi totally ignored the guys in our class and removed her sailor uniform before they had left.
    >
    > It was as if, to her, the guys were pumpkins or potato sacks, and she couldn't care less. Without any expression, she would throw her uniform onto the desk and start to get into her sweatshirt...But, seriously, Haruhi has a really great figure... argh, this isn't the time to say that kind of thing." -->

[^bunny]: 兔女郎装前文已提及。更尖锐的案例是春日的某个习惯（第一卷第一章）:

    > 线索二。
    >
    > 因为体育课是男女分开上，所以都是五班六班合并上课。换衣服的时候，女生集中在奇数班级，男生则在偶数班级。所以当上一节课结束后，五班的男生自然就会为了换衣服移动到六班的教室。
    >
    > 可是，春日完全不管班上的男生是否还在场，就自顾自地脱掉水手服。
    >
    > 简直就像在场的男生都是南瓜或马铃薯一样，她面无表情地将脱下来的水手服扔在桌上，然后开始换体育服。……不过说真的，春日的身材实在很不赖呢……啊，现在不是讲这种事的时候！

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- I contend that Haruhi does not - as she derives no gratification from it, not being a lesbian, nor does she really care about Mikuru apart from her utility^["I leaned on the corridor wall and waited for them to change. Seems like Haruhi wasn't really a born exhibitionist, just that she had no idea what effect the sight of her being half naked would have on guys. The reason she dressed herself up in a bunny costume wasn't really to show off her sexy body, but rather to attract people's attention." Chapter 2, Book 1] to the SOS Brigade (she's a lackey, a rival, or a plaything) - but there is another major character who is both greatly pleased by Haruhi's actions and shamed by his pleasure^[Kyon repeatedly enjoys Haruhi's molestations, right from the start. Consider his first encounter with Mikuru in Chapter 2 of Book 1: "Asahina-san screamed instantly. But Haruhi was unmoved, clutching her breasts through her sailor uniform. \ 'Aaaaa!' \ 'She's so small, yet her breasts are larger than mine! A cute face plus large breasts is also an important factor in turning people on!' \ Oh my god, I'm about to faint."]. Haruhi's body is another issue; Kyon is quite physically attracted to her ^["I still remember how gleaming her white neck was - standing there was an astounding beauty. Haruhi, with her provocative eyes, scanned the class slowly, stopped to glare at me (I had my mouth wide open), and then sat down without so much as a smile." Chapter 1, Book 1], yet Haruhi herself cares little for physical beauty and uses her athleticism without a thought. -->

我主张春日并无此癖——因为她并非同性恋，无法从中获得满足，对实玖瑠的关心也仅限于其对 SOS 团的工具价值^[「我靠在走廊的墙上，等她们两人换好衣服。看来春日并不是爱露，只是她根本不知道自己半裸的模样对男生有什么样的影响。她打扮成兔女郎并不是想表现煽情的一面，纯粹是想引人注意而已。」第一卷第二章]（实玖瑠在 SOS 团只是仆人、情敌或玩物）——但还有另一个主要角色，既从春日的行为中获得极大愉悦，又为此羞耻^[阿虚自始至终享受春日的骚扰。试看第一卷第二章初见实玖瑠的场景：「朝比奈立刻大叫。但春日却不为所动地隔着水手服，紧握着她的胸部不放。『哇啊啊啊！』『明明个子不高，胸部却比我还大呢！可爱的脸蛋加上巨乳的身材，这也是一个吸引人的重要要素！』天哪，我快昏倒了！」]。至于春日本人的身体，则对阿虚有强烈生理吸引^[「我还记得春日白皙的喉咙是那样的耀眼，是个不折不扣的美人。春日以十足挑衅的眼神缓缓巡视室内一周，最后瞪了嘴巴大开的我片刻后，便笑也不笑地坐了下来。」第一卷第一章]，然而春日自身却对美貌漠不关心，运动天赋也纯属本能运用。

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- We can tie this line of thought to larger concerns: is it not true that fans enjoy anime in part because things happen in the anime that would never happen in real life (eg: [harem animes](!W)), or that we would ever actually do (eg: martial arts, action, and sports anime)? -->

此思路可引申至更广泛的议题：动画粉丝的乐趣，难道不正是源于动画中的事情在现实中绝不会发生（如[后宫动画](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harem_animes)^[译注：此链接似乎已失效]），或我们实际上不会去做（如格斗、动作与体育题材）吗？

<!-- For an anime, those who are gratified are the fans and creators, who stand to the anime in respect of god. The analogy for _Haruhi_ is clear. -->

一部动画真正满足的是粉丝与创作者，他们对动画怀有崇高的敬意。《凉宫春日》的类比不言自明。

<!-- More prosaic examples of the true beneficiary of events might include Haruhi obtaining a computer; who winds up using it and creating the SOS Brigade website? Kyon. -->

更直白的「真实受益者」案例有：春日获取电脑后，真正使用它并创建了 SOS 团官网的是谁？阿虚。

<!-- Or, consider one of the examples in the [Losses](#the-god-that-failed) section: Haruhi wanted to be with Kyon, but on the other hand, Kyon likes Mikuru (whom he went with the first time), and had good reason to want to be alone with Nagato, who had only recently revealed her true nature to him. Under the Kyon-_kami_ interpretation, Haruhi losing the draw is expected. -->

再如[「失败的神明」](#the-god-that-failed)章节中的抽签事件：春日想与阿虚同组，但阿虚喜欢实玖瑠（首次抽中同组），且他有充分理由希望与刚揭露身份的长门独处。在「虚神论」的解读下，春日抽签失利是意料之中的。

<!-- ##### "Endless Eight" -->

##### 「漫无止境的八月」

<!-- "Endless Eight" puts the SOS-dan in a time loop where they repeat the end of summer vacation, endlessly going through a list of stereotypical^[Perhaps more stereotypical in anime than Japanese culture in general. The anime adaptation re-animates the same episode many times, in a bizarre waste of resources; the best defense (although surely not what was intended) was that the episodes represented a ["scathing critique of otakudom"](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9skki/what_superpopular_anime_titles_have_you_come/c0elcgj/).] activities like the pool or a festival with fireworks. Itsuki suggests that Haruhi keeps resetting the world (and herself) because they omitted some activity and left Haruhi unsatisfied. Eventually, Kyon realizes that the missing ingredient is a group session to do homework, and time moves on. -->

「漫无止境的八月」将 SOS 团困在时间循环里，他们不断重复暑假的尾声，无休止地经历一系列刻板活动^[这些活动在动画中或许比日本文化本身更显刻板。动画版多次重复制作相同剧集，浪费了大量资源。最佳辩护（尽管肯定不是制作本意）是这几集代表了「[对御宅文化的尖锐批判](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9skki/what_superpopular_anime_titles_have_you_come/c0elcgj/)」。]，诸如泳池嬉戏或烟火大会。一树推测，春日不断重置世界（包括自己）是因为他们遗漏了某项活动，使春日未获满足。最终，阿虚意识到缺失的环节是集体赶作业的读书会，时间得以重启流动。

<!-- Naturally, one assumes it's Haruhi's homework that was left undone. Japanese schools assign a lot of summer homework (unlike American schools) and it's natural to regret and fear the first day of school. Perfectly reasonable for her to reset the universe, and then procrastinate her homework in favor of having fun. -->

自然，人们会认定未完成的是春日的作业。日本学校会布置大量暑假作业（远超美国学校），对开学第一天的懊悔与恐惧实属正常。她为此重置宇宙，然后拖延作业以享受乐趣，这逻辑完全合理。

<!-- But no! Haruhi's homework is done! (The anime even shows her spending the group session playing videogames with Kyon's sister.) The person whose homework is undone is... *Kyon*. -->

但并非如此！春日的作业早已完成！（动画甚至展现她在读书会时陪阿虚妹妹打游戏。）真正作业未完成的人是……**阿虚**。

<!-- Once again, we see the question of _cui bono_. Who benefits from the group session? Why would Haruhi regret the SOS-dan not doing homework together, of all things? To suggest that she regrets it *so* much as to reset the world is... a bit strained, I think, especially considering that if she had ever thought of it, she would have put it on the list and they would have done it (Haruhi had even allotted a spare day for such a last-minute thought). Another explanation, that Haruhi wanted *someone* to take initiative and suggest something, anything, to do is also a little odd; in >15,000 iterations no one ever suggested a single activity? I could understand Kyon not suggesting - of all things - a homework session for that many iterations, but it beggars belief that not a single SOS-dan member would suggest a single activity for 15,000 iterations. Itsuki's explanation - that Haruhi regrets the inconvenience the others will experience with undone homework - is so contradictory to what any person would expect of Haruhi (that monster of egotism) I am tempted to take it as sarcasm. -->

我们再次面临「谁受益」的问题。读书会对谁有利？春日怎会因 SOS 团没有集体赶作业而懊悔到如此地步？认定她因此懊悔到**重置世界**……未免牵强，尤其考虑到如果她真的在意这件事，早该将其列入清单执行（春日甚至为临时起意的想法预留了一天）。另一解释是，春日希望**有人**主动提议活动，但这同样可疑：超过 15000 次循环中竟无人提出任何建议？阿虚 15000 次都未提议赶作业尚可理解，但全员 15000 次毫无提议简直荒谬。一树所谓「春日担心他人作业未完成的困扰」的解释，与春日极端自我的人设矛盾到近乎反讽。

<!-- But for Kyon? No, I could understand him resorting to a reset. When has Kyon ever worked hard? -->

但阿虚呢？是的，我完全理解他可能诉诸重置。阿虚什么时候努力写过作业？

<!-- There is also an issue here of why Haruhi seems to suffer from no déjà vu whatsoever, while Kyon suffers the most - in other words, why the reset works perfectly on *Haruhi* and the world, not so well on Mikuru and Itsuki, even less on Kyon, and not at all on Yuki. This sort of consideration of 'who has power over whom?' leads directly into the next section. -->

这里还存在另一个疑点：为何春日毫无既视感，而阿虚受苦最深？换言之，为何重置对**春日**和世界完美生效，对实玖瑠和一树效果稍逊，对阿虚收效甚微，对长门则完全无效？这种「谁掌控谁」的考量将直接引向下节内容。

<!-- #### _Cui Regio?_ -->

#### 谁主宰？^[译注：原文「Cui Regio?」，下文同]

<!-- Perhaps you dislike pointing to Haruhi losing in small incidents. Perhaps Kyon loses in some way, and often enough that his losses are as difficult to explain on the Kyon-_kami_ theory as on the Haruhi-_kami_ theory. -->

或许你不满于列举春日在小事上的挫败。或许阿虚也存在某些难以解释的失利，无论用「虚神论」还是「凉神论」都难以自圆其说。

<!-- Perhaps. So we might want an alternate tack - situations in which Haruhi is treated in a way that ought to be impossible for a god. One major example come to mind that is difficult to explain away with Haruhi-_kami_. -->

确实可能存在这种情况。因此我们也许需要另辟蹊径——检视春日遭受的不可能发生在神明身上的对待。一个难以用「凉神论」解释的关键例子浮现在眼前。

<!-- ##### _The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya_ -->

##### 《凉宫春日的消失》

<!-- While fairly complex due to its time travel, the plot of the 4<sup>th</sup> book is: Yuki falls in love with Kyon, and seeing his claimed distress at the SOS-dan's paranormal adventures, rewrites the world to render normal all aliens, time travelers, or ESPers, leaving intact only Kyon himself. Her power to do so, it is claimed, is stolen from Haruhi. Haruhi is rendered as powerless and normal as anyone else; she is restored to her usual self when Kyon rejects the mundanified world in favor of the old one. -->

尽管时间旅行使第四卷剧情相当复杂，其主线可简述为：有希爱上了阿虚，因看到他声称在 SOS 团的超自然冒险中感到痛苦，于是改写了世界规则，消除了所有外星人、时间旅行者与超能力者的异常，仅保留阿虚本人不变。据称，她实施此举的力量窃取自春日。春日因此变得和普通人一样没有力量；直至阿虚拒绝平凡的世界，选择回归原状时，她才恢复常态。

<!-- There are multiple points of interest in _Disappearance_. -->

《消失》有多个疑点值得关注。

<!-- Firstly, Kyon's rejection of the truly normal world gives the lie to all his previous claims. We can no longer argue in good faith that Kyon dislikes paranormal phenomenon and his dislike is disproof of Kyon-_kami_. -->

首先，阿虚对真正平凡世界的抗拒，彻底揭穿了他先前的所有宣称。我们无法再善意辩称阿虚厌恶超自然现象从而反驳「虚神论」。

<!-- In book 1, Kyon rejecting Haruhi's new world could be explained away as him fearing or disliking whatever extreme novelties Haruhi no doubt populated the new world with. -->

第一卷中，阿虚拒绝春日的新世界，尚可解释为恐惧春日在新世界中填充的极端奇观。

<!-- But this rejection cannot be so easily escaped: it's made 100% clear that Yuki's world is completely mundane, safer in that regard, and circumstances even conspire to bring the SOS-dan together - so Kyon sacrifices nothing whatsoever. The *only* reason to reject Yuki's world is if he truly does want paranormal events. This choice renders Kyon even more consistent with Kyon-_kami_.   -->

但这次的拒绝无从开脱：有希创造的世界是明确的 100% 完全平凡，更加安全，甚至在机缘巧合下 SOS 团成员依然相聚了——阿虚无需作出任何牺牲。拒绝这个世界的**唯一**理由，是他真心渴望超常事件。这一选择使阿虚与「虚神」的身份更为契合。

<!-- The second major issue is: how is _Disappearance_ even possible? It's glossed over, but it's clear that Yuki has changed the entire universe, and is not merely masking things, nor is Haruhi a fake or deluded version, but a genuinely powerless high school girl. As Yuki says: -->

第二大疑点在于：《消失》怎么可能发生？虽被轻描淡写，但有希显然重塑了整个宇宙，而非简单伪装，春日也不是虚假或被蒙蔽的版本，而是真正没有力量的女高中生。正如有希所言：

<!-- > "Therefore, the altered Suzumiya Haruhi does not possess the power to create data. In that dimension, the Integrated Data Sentient Entity is non-existent as well." -->

> 「因此，改变后的凉宫春日没有任何力量。没有创造资讯的能力。在那个时空里，资讯统合思念体也不存在。」^[译注：译文出自第四卷第四章]

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- And the origin of the power? -->

而力量的来源？  

<!-- > "Using the powers stolen from Suzumiya Haruhi, the temporal converter was able to alter data concerning past memories in the range of 365 days." -->

> 「借由凉宫春日身上窃取的能力，时空改变者得以修正的过去记忆资讯，是三百六十五日期间的范围。」^[译注：译文出自第四卷第四章]

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- Riddle me this: how can an omnipotent god lose its powers? How can it be altered by its own powers? (Remember, Yuki never lies about important things to Kyon, and if you assume her power comes from her creators, that raises even more issues.) How can the power be restored to it? -->

问题来了：全知全能的神怎么会丧失力量？祂自身的力量又怎么会篡改自身？（谨记：有希从不对阿虚在要事上撒谎，若假设她的力量来自其创造者，则会引发更多矛盾。）神力又怎么会失而复得？

<!-- How does _Disappearance_ make sense if Haruhi is the creator of the universe, its sustainer, and omnipotent? How does it make sense if she is only an unique data-generating organism more powerful than the IDE? How does it make sense if she is the master of dimensions and time, who can permit or forbid time-travel? -->

若春日真是宇宙创造者、维系者，又有全能的力量，《消失》事件如何成立？若她仅是比数据统合思念体更强大的独特数据生成体，事件如何成立？若她是时空主宰者，能允许或禁止时间旅行，事件又如何成立？

<!-- On the other hand, it's not so strange if the power is merely a gift, a loan, or stolen itself. What has been stolen once can be stolen twice. Haruhi wielded the power for a time, unconscious; little surprise if it could be stolen from its sleeping owner, and even less surprise if its new owner, Yuki, wields it far more dramatically. -->

反之，若此力量只是赠予、暂借，或本身就是偷来的，一切便不足为奇。曾被窃取之物自然可以再次被盗。春日一度无意识地挥霍这种力量。若这力量能从沉睡的主人身旁被偷走，那就不奇怪了；而其新主人长门能够更戏剧化地运用之，则更在情理之中。

<!-- ##### The Club -->

##### SOS 团

<!-- > That's how we first encountered each other. I solemnly swear---I really want to believe it was just a coincidence.
>
> Kyon^[Chapter 1, Book 1] -->

> 这就是我们的相遇。真令人难以忘怀，我真的很想相信那只是偶然。
>
> ——阿虚^[第一卷第一章]

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- One thing would suggest the universe is designed for Haruhi and not Kyon. The club would seem to be the best example - doesn't it just impose on Kyon? (Let's leave aside the mystery for Haruhi-_kami_ proponents of how Kyon, who Haruhi apparently didn't love at that point, got into the club in the first place.) -->

有一件事暗示宇宙为春日而非阿虚设计。SOS 团的存在似乎是最好的例子——它难道不是强加于阿虚的负担吗？（姑且搁置「凉神论」面临的矛盾：当时春日显然未爱上阿虚，他如何能入团？）

<!-- It is true that Haruhi enjoys the club, but ultimately she is not the instigator and main beneficiary of events. As Koizumi points out, Kyon suggested the club, and Kyon is in love with Haruhi from the start. From the moment she stands up, he is rapt and fascinated by her. They are even seated together (despite the seats randomly changing every month^["It seems that someone decided everyone in class needed to change their seats monthly. Therefore, the class monitor, Asakura, wrote all the seat numbers onto little pieces of paper, placed them in a cookie tin, and let each of us draw from it. In the end, I got the seat in the second to last row next to the window that overlooks the courtyard. Guess who took the last seat right behind me? That's right. It was the ever-scowling Haruhi!" Book 1, Chapter 1]). If the real story is just Haruhi-_kami_, then that's some coincidence. But it makes perfect sense if we postulate Kyon-_kami_. -->

诚然春日享受社团活动，但她终究不是事件的发起者与核心受益者。正如古泉指出：是阿虚提议组建社团，而且他一开始就倾慕春日。从她站起来那刻起，阿虚就为之神魂颠倒。他们甚至坐在一起（尽管每月随机换位^[「似乎之前就决定每个月都要换一次位子，所以班长朝仓凉子便将四折的纸片放进饼干罐子里当签让大家抽，最后我换到面向中庭的窗边倒数第二个位子。而我后面的最后一个位子到底是坐谁呢？没错，正是此时一张臭脸的凉宫春日！」第一卷第一章]）。若真相只是「凉神论」，未免过于巧合。但若假设「虚神论」成立，一切便顺理成章。

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- #### Miscellaneous Points -->

#### 其他佐证

> 这样的我很正常吧？
>
> ——阿虚^[第一卷第一章]

<!-- ！原文 -->

<!-- - Kyon is the narrator, as befits the tutelary deity of the anime. He also just goes by 'Kyon'. No last name, he's always just 'Kyon'. (Gives off a sort of Jesus vibe.)
- Kyon is also remarkably stable and consistent throughout all the events. Not only is he remarkably sanguine - far more calm than his more esoteric clubmates - he is also affected less by various dimensional and time-travel and alternate universe changes.[^rpg]
- From day one, it is Kyon who approaches Haruhi and not the other way around. In the final episode, Haruhi comes to realize she is happy with the world as it is and with her friends and Kyon. This averts the imminent Armageddon, but is it that God was pleased and changed her mind, or that God was glad that Haruhi had found a world she could be happy in, and so he refrained from changing things?
- Another way to put it is like this: if everyone and everything that is happening happens at Haruhi's wish, then how did she come to wish for Kyon when she doesn't even begin to switch from _tsun_ to _dere_ entire episodes in? Shouldn't Kyon's repeated declarations that he is utterly ordinary and hopes for a life of utter ordinariness make us suspicious? Shouldn't it bother us that Kyon hopes deep down for excitement and admits as much (episode 2)? Shouldn't it bother us that the 'melancholy' of the title could as easily be Kyon's?
- The later novels apparently focus more on the other characters, and less on Haruhi. A little strange...
- For that matter, isn't it remarkable how Kyon can order around the other club members and even Haruhi to some extent? One might not expect timid Mikuru to exert any authority over Kyon, but you would think Itsuki or Yuki would at some point brusquely order Kyon around. (Why not? He's just an ordinary with no powers...)
- Misc. notes on episode 14: Kyon precedes Haruhi to the dream world, and knows more about it than she. When the two are arguing, Haruhi doesn't say that she herself was bored and fed up with the old world, but claims that Kyon was, and Kyon's own narration supports this:

    > That's right, that day we conducted our SOS Brigade activities peacefully. Nothing associated with aliens from a different dimension, time travelers from the future, blue giants, or red glowing spheres happened at that time. No one wanted to do anything special, nor did anyone know what they should have been doing. We just allowed ourselves to ride on the flow of time, living our high school life idly. Everything seemed perfectly normal.\
    > Even though I was dissatisfied with such a normal life, I'd always tell myself, "Why think so much? You've got so much time." And then I would once again look forward to the next day.^[Chapter 7, Book 1]
- There's an interesting quote early on:

    > Taniguchi sarcastically put on an awed expression. Then Kunikida popped up from behind Taniguchi.\
    > "Kyon's always gone out with strange girls."\
    > Hey, don't say things that'll create a misunderstanding.\
    > "It doesn't matter if Kyon likes strange girls. What I can't understand is, why Suzumiya would talk to you? I don't get it at all."^[Book 1, Chapter 1]
- Haruhi appears disappointed that the 'mysterious transfer student' is male, and not female. Kyon, though, is pleased. -->

- 阿虚作为叙述者，正契合这部动画守护神的身份。他也仅以「阿虚」自称——没有姓氏，始终是「阿虚」。（隐约透出耶稣那样的神性气质。）
- 阿虚在所有事件中都展现出了非凡的稳定性与一致性。他不仅异常镇定（远超其他更为神秘的团员），而且在各种维度穿越、时间旅行与平行宇宙变迁中受影响最小。[^rpg]
- 自始至终都是阿虚主动接近春日，而非反之。在最终话，春日领悟到自己满足于当下的世界、伙伴与阿虚。这避免了世界末日，但神明究竟是因感到满意而改变心意，还是因春日找到幸福的世界而放弃改变世界？
- 换句话说：如果一切都是春日愿望的结果，那她尚未从「傲」转「娇」时怎会渴望阿虚出现？阿虚反复宣称自己非常普通、希望过平凡的人生，难道不可疑吗？他内心深处渴望刺激，并承认了这一点（第二集），岂不奇怪？标题的「忧郁」同样适用于阿虚，岂不奇怪？
- 后续小说明显更聚焦其他角色而淡化春日。略显蹊跷……
- 此外，阿虚能号令其他团员，甚至在一定程度上支配春日，难道不值得注意吗？怯懦的实玖瑠无力约束阿虚尚可理解，但古泉或长门也从未对他发号施令。（为何如此？他不过是个毫无能力的普通人啊……）
- 第十四集细节补遗：阿虚比春日更早进入梦境世界，而且知道的更多。两人争执时，春日并未抱怨自己厌倦旧世界，却声称阿虚对旧世界心怀不满。而阿虚的自述也印证了这一点：

    > 没错，那天我们就这样平静地进行 SOS 团的活动。这里跟异空间的外星人、来自未来的访客、蓝色的巨人和红色的光球完全无关。没什么特别想要做的事、也不知道该做什么，只是任凭自己悠游在时间的洪流里，过着无忧无虑的高中生活。一切是那么地理所当然，而且平凡无奇。
    >
    > 尽管会对平凡的生活感到不满，但总会对自己说「干嘛想那么多，反正时间还多得很」，然后一次又一次悠然地迎接明天地到来。^[第一卷第七章]
- 开篇有段耐人寻味的对话：

    > 谷口刻意做出非常吃惊的表情。国木田突然从后面探出头来。
    >
    > 「阿虚从以前就很喜欢奇怪的女生了。」
    >
    > 喂，别说那种会引起误会的话啦！
    >
    > 「就算阿虚喜欢怪女生也没关系。我不能理解的是，为什么凉宫会乖乖跟你聊天。实在搞不懂。」^[第一卷第一章]
- 春日对「神秘转学生」是男性而非女性流露失望，阿虚却很高兴。

    > 「我们这是在哪儿？」我问道。「这 RPG 般的世界是怎么回事？为什么我们会在这儿？谁把我们弄来的？」

这似乎无法解释春日——她不过是个行为古怪的普通女孩，恰被阿虚用作挡箭牌。但若深入审视，阿虚自己也承认了这一点：

<!-- > "In a way, doesn't that make me an insider to this mysterious event? Just as I said in the beginning, I had wanted to be a bystander that got sucked into these events, content with being a mere sidekick. But as things stood, I was already the protagonist!

<!-- We must of course consider evidence militating against Kyon being God. -->

当然也得考虑那些反驳阿虚是神的证据。

<!-- #### The God's God -->

#### 神明的神明

<!-- One particularly important bit of evidence is [an interview](https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Interview_with_Tanigawa_Nagaru) with the novel author. I've always respected the ability of readers to get more value, or entertainment, or moral reflection out of a work than the author had put in it - but I still feel the author is the final word on what happened in a book. So let's see what Nagaru has to say: -->

一项关键证据是小说作者的[采访](https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Interview_with_Tanigawa_Nagaru)。我一向尊重读者从作品中挖掘超越作者本意的价值、娱乐或道德反思的能力——但作者仍应是作品内容的最终裁定者。且看谷川流的回答：

<!-- > "I had wanted to write novels for many years, rather than to be an author. I think it's because some 'I wanna write novels by myself' neural networks were gradually established in my brain while I read various kinds of novels in my childhood. I still don't know if I'm a writer or whatever." -->

> 多年来我想要的一直是写小说本身，而非成为作家。这大概源于童年阅读各类小说时，「我要自己写小说」的神经回路在脑中逐渐建立。我至今仍不确定自己算不算作家。

<!-- That's a positive point. A literary man is naturally sympathetic to such a plot inversion as I suggest here. -->

这是个积极信号。文学创作者自然能理解我提出的剧情反转。

<!-- > "_Q:_ When and how was the typical incompliant character, Suzumiya Haruhi, born?

> _Nagaru:_ I can't remember at all. She already existed in my mind by the time I noticed her there. In a sleepless night at the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the idea seemed to have come down from heaven into my head at the moment I rolled over in bed." -->

不妙。作者用神性词汇描述春日，暗示他认同「凉神论」。

<!-- > "_Q:_ Haruhi hates boredom most of all and seeks 'extraordinariness' in school life. And the one who is always at her beck and call is the narrator of this story, Kyon. He is an ordinary boy with no outstanding features, whose name is not even revealed. What do you think about him?

> _Nagaru:_ Though I could give him a decent name, I thought it feels stupid and funny that he is called by that queer nickname from beginning to end. As for his featurelessness, I originally planned he would be an ESPer, but while writing the Prologue, I had subconsciously turned him into a common person. And you said he is an ordinary boy, but I think, in a sense, he is not an ordinary boy, such as his way of thinking." -->

> 问：春日最讨厌无聊，在校园生活中追求「与众不同」。而一直听她使唤的叙述者阿虚，是个普通的少年，连名字也没透露。您如何看待他？
>
> 谷川：虽然可以给他取个正式的姓名，但觉得从头到尾以那个奇怪的绰号称呼他，显得又傻又好笑。至于他的平凡，我原本计划把他写成超能力者，但写序章时不自觉把他变成了普通人。你说他是普通少年，但我认为，从某种意义上说，他思维独特，并不普通。

<!-- Even worse; one of the central arguments for Kyon-_kami_ is his lack of apparent powers - but here he apparently *had* those powers and lost them through mere authorial oversight at the last minute! And other curious aspects, like his name, are waved away as further evidence of his anonymity and mundanity. His only unique feature is his philosophical way of thinking. -->

更糟的是，「虚神论」的核心论据之一便是他表面上缺乏能力——但此处显示他原本**拥有**这些能力，却在最后一刻被作者下意识改掉！其他疑点（如姓名缺失）也被轻描淡写地视为其匿名性与平凡性的佐证。他唯一的特质只剩哲学式的思维。

<!-- This is not a smoking gun against Kyon-_kami_ since the grand inversion or subversion could have occurred to Nagaru only after most of the elements were in place, and series can sometimes change dramatically while being written (if Nagaru had even planned out more than the initial setting or the first novel); for example, over the 10 novels there is a major shift in emphasis from Haruhi to Yuki Nagato, although someone reading the first novel would be hard pressed to guess that Yuki would become such a focus as opposed to another character like Mikuru or Itsuki. -->

这并非对「虚神论」的确凿反证，因为这种重大转变或反转可能发生在谷川流已设定好多数元素之后，而系列作品在创作中有时会大改剧情（若他甚至计划了超出设定或第一卷的内容）；例如，10 卷间重心明显从春日转向长门有希，而第一卷读者很难预料有希会成为核心人物，而非实玖瑠或一树。

<!-- ### A Pox On Both Your Houses -->

### 两败俱伤

<!-- And let's not forget the aspects that don't seem to work for either Kyon-_kami_ or Haruhi-_kami_. Consider the making the festival film in book 2; Haruhi remarks that she wanted a local Shinto shrine stuffed with white birds instead of ugly ordinary one. Kyon is taken there the day after, and sure enough, all the birds are vividly white. Or in book 2, Haruhi's screenplay demand that Mikuru have destructive eyebeams (lasers, mini-black holes, etc.), which nearly kill Kyon several times. Neither case seems quite right; why would Kyon make the birds white the day *after*, when Haruhi will never see or know of them? Why would Kyon endue Mikuru with entirely unnecessarily destructive powers which nearly kill him, and damage Yuki whom he likes? For that matter, why would Haruhi turn the birds white only long after she needs them white for her movie; ditto for the eyebeams. -->

更别忘了那些既不符合「虚神论」也不契合「凉神论」的方面。试看第二卷的学园祭电影拍摄：春日抱怨当地神社本应布满白鸟，而非丑陋而普通的鸟。次日，阿虚前往那里，所有的鸟竟真变得雪白耀眼。另在第二卷中，春日的剧本要求实玖瑠拥有毁灭性的眼部光束（激光、微型黑洞等），这些能力多次险些让阿虚丧命。两件事都不太合理：为何阿虚要在春日永远无法目睹的**第二天**将鸟变白？他又为何赋予实玖瑠完全不必要的致命能力，险些害死自己并伤及他心仪的有希？同理，春日为何在需要白鸟拍电影的很久以后才使之变色？眼部光束的设定有同样的矛盾。

<!-- Are you ready to go all the way down the Wolfe den? Here's the *real* story: -->

准备好深入沃尔夫式解读^[译注：原文「the Wolfe den」，可能是狼穴「the wolf den」的谐音]了吗？**真正**的故事是这样的：

<!-- There once was a lonely god who lived as a human. He lived his life and eventually even he thought he was just a human in an ordinary world - because even the most extraordinary world becomes ordinary after long enough. He fell in love with an unusual girl. Still ignorant, he sought to create a world she could be happy in and where he could go on adventures and they could do all sorts of fun things together and perhaps even fall in love. The end. -->

曾有位孤独的神明以人类身份生活。他度过漫长岁月，最终连自己都相信只是平凡世界的普通人——因为再非凡的世界历经时光也会归于平淡。他爱上了一个特别的女孩。仍不自知的他，试图创造她能在其中获得幸福的世界，一个能继续冒险、共度欢乐时光，甚至可能相爱的世界。故事至此结束。

<!-- Ludicrous? Consider the scenario we are asked to accept at face value: Haruhi unknowingly creates the world and all the paranormal factions, but nothing happens for 3 years, and she just so happens to run into Kyon at high school and form a club with him; and Kyon comes to be crucial and confided in by them, because simultaneously Haruhi seems to becoming fond of him. -->

荒谬吗？且看我们被要求全盘接受的设定：春日无意识地创造了世界及所有超自然势力，却整整三年波澜不惊，只是偏巧在高中遇见阿虚，并与他组建社团；而阿虚恰因春日对他萌生好感，成为各方势力信赖的关键人物。

<!-- Isn't that scenario actually *more* complex than a scenario in which Kyon-_kami_ creates a world to live in with Haruhi, and tries to let her happy by forming the SOS Brigade and creating the members necessary to carry out its functions and put her at the center of things? Kyon-_kami_ would want to know and participate in events. He couldn't enjoy the club as he did if he were in the ignorant Haruhi's position. And enjoy the club he and Haruhi does. it's worth repeating this thought: Haruhi is happy, even though she is cut out of most of the supernatural events - in the end, ["the Power of Friendship"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship) defeats her melancholia. To return to the [previous criticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9skki/what_superpopular_anime_titles_have_you_come/c0elcgj/) of the "Endless Eight" episodes in season 2: -->

难道这设定不比「『虚神』创造世界与春日共处，通过组建 SOS 团、捏造必要成员，并将她置于中心以让她幸福」的情节**更**复杂吗？「虚神」希望了解并参与各种事件。若处于春日那样无知的立场，他不可能像现在这样享受社团活动。而他和春日确实乐在其中。值得重申：春日虽被排除在多数超常事件外，却依然幸福，因为最终[「友谊的力量」](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship)治愈了她的忧郁。回顾第二季「漫无止境的八月」剧集所受的[批判](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9skki/what_superpopular_anime_titles_have_you_come/c0elcgj/)：

<!-- > At another level, I feel that KyoAni's rendition Endless Eight was, in fact, a scathing criticism of otakudom. Here you are, Endless Eight said to me, sitting down every goddamn week to watch the same goddamn anime. Outside it's summer and there are infinite possibilities, infinite lives you could live; Haruhi's even compiled a list! But no, you're a fucking moron. You're living an endless loop of the same day, just like these guys, and Endless Eight is your punishment. -->

> 另一个层面上，我认为京都动画呈现的「漫无止境的八月」实为对御宅文化的辛辣批判。它仿佛在对我说：你每周雷打不动坐在那里，看着同一部该死的动画。窗外盛夏正盛，人生充满无限可能；春日甚至列了愿望清单！但你是个蠢货。你像这些家伙一样，活在日复一日的循环里，「漫无止境的八月」就是对你的惩罚。

<!-- > ...After the sequence in which Bunny Girl flies around tirelessly, everything is destroyed by (what can only be construed as) an atomic bomb. In the ensuing whirlwind, petals from Japan's national flower, the cherry blossom, engulf everything in a blast of pink; the streets become scorched earth, mountains are burnt bare, and the whole world becomes a wasteland. Amidst this devastation, Spaceship _DAICON_, symbolizing _otaku_, floats in midair emitting a powerful beam - the beam of science-fiction fans. The world revives, giant trees rise in a flash, and Mother Earth is once again bedecked in green. Characters from the world of science fiction gather on the restored planet to celebrate. In accordance with the rubrics of _otaku_ taste, all of the characters are happy, their chests puffed up proudly at the light of hope. Characters who have never occupied the same screen gradually interact with each other and assemble in the final mob scene - a perfect encapsulation of the science-fiction conference's message...Hideaki Anno, who later directed _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, created the explosion scene, and it is almost painful to watch his pathological obsession with it, as an atomic whirlwind destroys the city...One indication of the filmmakers' obsession with quality and concept was their use of a then-rare personal computer, which enabled them to calculate planetary orbits and thus design the solar system that appears in the last scene. The complexity of this design process offers further evidence of the filmmakers' obsession with realism. Surprisingly, it turns out that the ultimate dream of _otaku_ aesthetics, scrupulous yet fanatically obsessed with reality, is a happy party, a peaceful festival. -->

<!-- Yes. Exactly. Just so. (One might ask why Kyon doesn't just give Haruhi her heart's desire; but if Haruhi knew that aliens and time travelers and ESPers weren't any more interesting than her clubmates, that would only destroy her happiness and return her melancholia.) The ending of the first novel takes on additional poignancy: -->

是的。正是如此。恰如其分。（可能有人问，为什么阿虚不直接实现春日的心愿？但如果她知道外星人、时间旅行者与超能力者不比 SOS 团成员更有趣，只会摧毁她的幸福，令她重陷忧郁。）第一卷的结局更显深意：

<!-- > "I didn't know whether her frown had to do with today's low attendance rate, or the fact that I arrived earlier than her. I'll just have to ask her when we get to the cafe...\

<!-- I feel this is a lovely story; it touches me. It may not be true. The story of _Haruhi_ may be just as it seems. But if it isn't true - it ought to be[^Borges]. -->

我认为这是个动人的故事，它触动了我。它或许并非真相。《凉宫春日》的故事也许只是表面上那样。但如果它不是真的——它应当是[^Borges]。^[译注：最后一句原文「But if it isn't true - it ought to be」]

<!-- [^Borges]: In this I follow the path of my master Jorge Luis Borges, in his review of Richard Hull's detective novel [_Excellent Intentions_](https://www.amazon.com/Excellent-Intentions-Penguin-Mystery-Paperback/dp/B005MGIW98/):

    > Here was my plan: to plot a detective novel of the current sort, with an indecipherable murder in the first pages, a long discussion in the middle, and a solution at the end. Then, almost in the last line, to add an ambiguous phrase - for example: "and everyone thought the meeting of the man and the woman had been by chance" - that would indicate, or raise the suspicion, that the solution was false. The perplexed reader would go through the pertinent chapters again, and devise his own solution, the correct one. The reader of this imaginary book would be sharper than the detective...
    >
    > [Hull's] solution, however, is so unsurprising that I cannot free myself from the suspicion that this quite real book, published in London, is the one I imagined in Balvanera, three or four years ago. In which case, _Excellent Intentions_ hides a secret plot. Ah me, or ah Richard Hull! I can't find that secret plot anywhere. -->

[^Borges]: 在此，我追随导师{豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯|Jorge Luis Borges}的步伐，他在对 Richard Hull 的侦探小说《[Excellent Intentions](https://www.amazon.com/Excellent-Intentions-Penguin-Mystery-Paperback/dp/B005MGIW98/)》的评论中写道：

    > 我的计划是：构思一部当代风格的侦探小说，开篇悬案难解，中段冗长辩论，结尾揭晓谜底。最后一行加入暧昧语句——例如「众人都以为那对男女的相遇纯属偶然」——暗示或引人怀疑结局虚假。困惑的读者将重读相关章节，推导出真正的答案。这本虚构作品的读者将比侦探更敏锐……
    >
    > 然而[赫尔的]解答如此平淡，令我不得不怀疑这本伦敦出版的真实之书，正是三四年前我在巴尔瓦内拉构想的那本。若真如此，《Excellent Intentions》便暗藏玄机。唉！我遍寻不着那隐秘的脉络。（译注：我同样没看过，也是 DeepSeek 翻译的。方括号原文也有，我不知用意何在）

<!-- To put it another way, supposing the Kyon-_kami_ hypothesis were true, the premise of the story (the strange life of an unwitting god) would still be correct. But then it wouldn't just be some of the characters who are unwitting, it would be *all* - even the audience wouldn't be in on the trick. -->

换言之，即便「虚神论」成立，故事的前提（不自知的神明经历奇异生活）依然成立。只不过届时蒙在鼓里的将不仅是某些角色，而是**所有人**——连观众都被戏弄于股掌之中。
